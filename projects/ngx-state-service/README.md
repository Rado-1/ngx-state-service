# ngx-state-service

Lightweight state management library for Angular.

Version: 0.1.0

## Compatibility with Angular versions

Angular `12.0.0` or higher is required.

## About

**ngx-state-service** provides much simpler approach than other robust state
management libraries, like [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/) or [ngxs](https://www.ngxs.io/), and is intended for developers who
need straightforward, type safe, effective, and practically usable solution with minimal boilerplate.

Even if the primary motivation was to solve the problem of local
component state for OnPush change detection strategy seamlessly propagated to
component template, the library can be used also for managing global application
state shared among components.
